We've supported Laravel for a long time, with many Laravel sites on Lagoon, but now we are striving to create the best possible experience for local development and deployment of Laravel on Lagoon. We're excited to announce the launch of [Sail on Lagoon](https://github.com/uselagoon/sailonlagoon), which lets Laravel users spin up a site on Lagoon in record time.

Our goal is to work with the Laravel community to find out how we can best support Laravel. We want to know more about how you interact with Laravel, what you use to develop and deploy, and what your hopes and dreams are for those tools! We'd love it if you could take a couple minutes to [fill out our short survey here](https://forms.gle/96cQHNQL6gKF3gZ78).
