The Lagoon tasks system allows arbitrarily-defined commands to be run in environments. These tasks can be defined at group, project, or environment level and can cascade down. These tasks can also be run conditionally based on facts or permissions.

An extension of the task system allows custom images to be provided to projects to perform specific commands or routines. This gives greater flexibility in image creation and facilitates a wider-range of one-off, or irregularly-run tasks to be performed across multiple environments.
