Lagoon has a range of tools that can compute and collect information from environments, which we refer to as “facts.” Information like application or package versions, current states or statuses, is gathered and stored back inside Lagoon, in a datastore. These facts can be used to filter or sort projects and environments.

Part of the *[Lagoon Insights](../lagoon-insights/)* tool suite.
