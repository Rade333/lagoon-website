# lagoon-website

This is the website at https://lagoon.sh

It is built in [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using the [Syna Theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/syna/) and hosted on [Lagoon](https://lagoon.sh)


# Development

Local development can be done using the Hugo cli `hugo server --disableFastRender -D`,
and the project can be started in Docker locally `docker-compose up -d`.

It'll get fancy at some point no doubt!
